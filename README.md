Remember when submitting issues:
 1. Give a clear and detailed description, and summarize it in the title
 2. Provide reproduction steps; what exactly did you do to cause the bug to happen? Can you make it happen again?
 3. Including a screenshot means there can be no mistaking where the bug occured, and can help show exactly what the problem is.
 4. Add any relevant labels to your issue to help us categorize it.
 5. You can suggest which milestone you think the issue belongs in, or just leave it and we'll assign an appropriate milestone.
